# FAQ
***I can't open Bluebird! It says something about malware?***

It won't let you open the app because I would have to pay $100 for verification, which I don't have the means for. If macOS won't let you open the app, open System Preferences, click "Security and Privacy", then click "Open Anyway" at the bottom. I promise there is no malware, because I don't have the technical knowledge to implement it.

***Pressing install says "Downloading" but the progress bar doesn't move!***

Sometimes the downloading framework I used doesn't work for some people. I would restart the app and try again. If that doesn't work, start the app, then download the latest game files for the selected game elsewhere. Place the zip in ~/Downloads/ then press Install. It should say "Predownloaded game files found" or something to that effect.

***After I press a button, it's stuck at "Looking for Quest"!***

99.99% of the time, this is because of the cable connected to the Quest. Try unplugging and replugging it, switching up the USB port it's plugged into on your Mac, or use a different cable.

***During install, it's stuck at "Pushing OBB"!***

This part does take a while, and the length of the process depends on the game. Give it lots of time, I'd say 10 minutes. If after that it's still stuck, restart Bluebird and try again.
