# Bluebird
Bluebird is a native macOS sideloader for Oculus Quest games.

# What games does it install?
As of right now, Bluebird will be able to install Pavlov: Shack, Contractors and HiBow. More games may or may not be added in the future, but no guarantees.

# Why "Bluebird"?
I was watching Naruto when I first created the repo, and my favorite OP from Naruto is Blue Bird. So no inspiring metaphor here. Also it's a cool name, so why not?
